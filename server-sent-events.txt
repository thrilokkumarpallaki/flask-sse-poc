Server Sent Events Connection HandShake

- user authenticate
- on successfull authentication of user response: sse-url with custom channel eg: http://localhost:5000/stream?channel='test'
- client will open eventsource in frontend with the url that received in previous step
- server can emit events with channel that will be stored when user specific event occurred



Server Sent Events Limitations:

- Only Server can send messages.(Clients will subscribe to the events)
- Only text data can be passed because the stream is text\event-stream
- Not suitable for binary data(eg: file, image, video)
- One Browser can only connect to 6 sse connection from a single domain if protocol is HTTP/1.1
- If protocol is HTTP/2.0 Browser can connect by default to 100 sse connection.
